# 9-DOF IMU Sensor
This folder contains the code used to measure orientation, velocities and acceleration using a 9-DEF IMU Sensor.
In this code example, the Adafruit BNO055 9-DOF IMU Sensor was used.

## Libraries
The code uses two libraries developed by Adafruit which gives various functions that returns the values from the IMU. The libraries are Adafruit_Sensor.h and Adafruit_BNO055.h.
