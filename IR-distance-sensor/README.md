# Distance IR Sensor
This folder contains the code used to measure distances using infrared sensors.
The libraries folders contains additional libraries that has been used in the code.
In this code example, the Sharp GP2Y0A41SK0F 0A41SK IR sensor is used. The sensor has a detection range of 4 - 30 cm.  

## Libraries
SharpIR-master contains functions used to calculate the distance using Sharp IR distance sensors. The library was written by Guillaume Rico and Thibaut Mauon (GitHub: https://github.com/guillaume-rico/SharpIR).
